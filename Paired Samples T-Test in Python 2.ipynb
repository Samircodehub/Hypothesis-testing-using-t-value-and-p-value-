    "* Q. Let us consider that we want to know whether an engine oil significantly impacts the carâ€™s mileage of different brands. In order to test this, we have 10 cars in a garage doped with original engine oil initially. We have noted their mileage for 100 kilometers each. Then, we have each of the cars doped with another engine oil (different from the original one). Then, the mileage of the cars is calculated for 100 kilometers each. To compare the difference between the mean mileage of the first and second test, we use a paired samples t-test because for each car their first test score can be paired with their second test score"
